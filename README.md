# Credit-card-validator

Credit cards are a need in this digital age where e-commerce is king. Before processing a payment, the majority of payment gateways use some sort of credit card data validation procedure. What if there was software that could perform this validation right away? The best course of action is to identify the type of card and then check to see if the entered number is a legitimate credit card number or not because the validation processes differ for various cards.

If things start out too complicated, it's OK to impose a drop-down or menu for selecting the type of card to verify against. Although this project's design is very straightforward, if one chooses to create it, they will need to have some understanding of algorithms.
